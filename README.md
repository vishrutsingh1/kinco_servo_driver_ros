# kinco_servo_driver_ros
ROS wrapper for the Kinco FD124S Series Servo Driver

This ROS driver provides an interface to the Kinco FD124S Series Servo Driver, enabling seamless integration with ROS-based robotic systems. 
The driver facilitates communication with the servo driver, allowing users to control and monitor motor operations effectively.

User need to set 
1) robot_base_width
2) robot_wheel_radius
3) gear_reduction_ratio

Note: communication is over RS232 reserved port of driver.
